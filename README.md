LogRhythm Frontend Exercise created in May, 2017 by Brandon Wells

I used Json Server in order to simulate a REST environment locally.

1) `gitclone https://github.com/TheBrandonWells/lr-frontend.git`
2) `cd lr-frontend`
3) `npm install` to install modules
4) `npm run start` to run locally
5) Wait for modules to build and visit at localhost `http://localhost:8888/`

http://localhost:3000/students/ to see the JSON data.

Please direct any questions to Brandon@brandonrwells.com
